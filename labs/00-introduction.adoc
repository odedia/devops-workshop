= Introduction: Labs Setup

Welcome to the lab! Here you will find a collection of exercises and accompanying source-code.

== Overview

This workshop contains a number of lab folders meant to be worked through in numerical order - as each exercise builds upon the last. There is also a _samples_ directory, containing completed applications that can be pushed to Cloud Foundry at any time.

Your workspace is the *my_work* folder. If you get stuck implementing any of the labs, *solutions* are available for your perusal.

== PCF Environment Access

This workshop assumes participants will be interacting with PCF One.  Depending on the client and environment, ask the instuctor for an alternate CF API endpoint and/or url for the Apps Manager UI.
